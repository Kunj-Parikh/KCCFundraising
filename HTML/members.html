            At KCC (Knights Conquering Cancer), our mission is clear and passionate: we strive to raise as much money as possible to donate to the American Cancer Society (ACS). We are a team of eleven dedicated students from Bergen County Academies (BCA) in New Jersey, united by a common goal to fight cancer. Many of us are involved in advanced cell biology research, focusing on cancer-related projects. This academic background illustrates our commitment and equips us with the knowledge to approach our mission with scientific rigor and valuable insight. <br><br>Our team is organized into various “departments,” such as communications, advertising, and social media. We aim to officially establish the KCC as a recognized club within BCA, expanding our impact and spreading awareness for this devastating disease. Donate today. Do your part to fight cancer.

I've enjoyed conducting biomedical research at school, so I'm very excited to be the Director of Research on our American Cancer Society team. My passion for cancer awareness started in middle school, where I innovated a cutting-edge stationary bike-stand for an immuno-compromised 4-year-old named Cole. Sadly, Cole is no longer with us anymore, but I found happiness in impacting his battle with cancer and his story continues to inspire my work in cancer advocacy today. Outside of school, my hobbies include soccer, piano, and biology/medical competitions. </p>
