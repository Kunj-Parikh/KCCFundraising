            At KCC (Knights Conquering Cancer), our mission is clear and passionate: we strive to raise as much money as
            possible to donate to the American Cancer Society (ACS). We are a team of eleven dedicated students from
            Bergen County Academies (BCA) in New Jersey, united by a common goal to fight cancer. Many of us are
            involved in advanced cell biology research, focusing on cancer-related projects. This academic background
            illustrates our commitment and equips us with the knowledge to approach our mission with scientific rigor
            and valuable insight. <br><br>Our team is organized into various “departments,” such as communications,
            advertising, and social media. We aim to officially establish the KCC as a recognized club within BCA,
            expanding our impact and spreading awareness for this devastating disease. Donate today. Do your part to
            fight cancer.

                treatment regimen, and also join a cancer research program. Other than research, I enjoy drawing,
